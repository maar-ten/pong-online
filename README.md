Pong
===

Pong is a classic video game created in the 70s by [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong). I recreated it as the final project for the CS50 computer science course that I did in 2020.

The goal of this project is to create the game in such a way that you can play it online against opponents.

To help with the development of the game I used a JavaScript game library called [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/).


Local installation

If you have NodeJS installed you can start a local http server by running `npx http-server` inside the project folder.

Then open http://localhost:8080 in a web browser to play solo.
